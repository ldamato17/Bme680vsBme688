# Comparative Analysis: Bosch BME680 vs BME688

## Description
This repository contains materials for my undergraduate thesis titled "Comparison between Bosch BME680 and BME688: Analysis of Differences and Impact of Artificial Intelligence in Ambient Sensors." The research aims to analyze the performance differences between the BME680 and BME688 sensors and evaluate the influence of artificial intelligence integration on ambient sensors.

## Repository Contents
- **code/BME_Comparison.ino**: Arduino IDE file containing the code for collecting and analyzing sensor data.

## Usage
1. Open the `BME_Comparison.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.
2. Upload the code to your Arduino board connected to either the BME680 or BME688 sensor.
3. Follow the instructions in the code comments to collect and analyze sensor data.
